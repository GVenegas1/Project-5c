# project-5c

Write a function named **without_duplicates** that takes a list argument and returns a new list that contains all of the same values from the list that was passed in, but with no duplicates. The values should appear in the new list in the order of their first appearance in the list that was passed in. The original list should remain unchanged.

For example, your function could be used like this:
```
my_list = [8, 'hello', 8, True, -1000000.4, 'hello', 8]
result = without_duplicates(my_list)
```

The file must be named: without_duplicates.py
